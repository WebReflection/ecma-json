# ecma-json
JSON as is with ECMAScript fixes

  * as _CJS_: `require('ecma-json')` or `require('ecma-json/cjs')`
  * as _ESM_: `import JSON from 'ecma-json/esm'` or `import JSON from 'https://unpkg.com/ecma-json?module'`
  * as global _browser_ object: `<script src="//unpkg.com/ecma-json"></script>`

## API

Exact same JSON API. The only thing fixed in here is what ECMAScript decided to fix.
